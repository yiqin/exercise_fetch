This exercise is intended to test a developer's basic familiarity with iOS development.
Completing it should take perhaps an hour and 100 lines of code.

Scenario:  This app mimics fetching and displaying data from a remote API
(although in this case no internet connectivity is required).
In particular, the app should fetch and display lines from a text.
The fetch has already been implemented in class EXTextFetcher,
but the app's main view controller is largely unimplemented.

Your task is to complete the implementation of EXFetchMainVeiwController
such that it:
* fetches one line on clicking 'Fetch next line'
* displays doneLabel when there are no more lines to fetch.

Included are screenshots of how the app should look
when some text has been fetched and when all text has been fetched.
